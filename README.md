## deepPERFECT: Novel Deep Learning CT Synthesis Method for Expeditious Pancreatic Cancer Radiotherapy
https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers15113061

deepPERFECT is a generative AI deep learning model that is trained to capture the differences in patient setup and acquisition techniques between the diagnostic CT scan and planning/simulation CT scan, and generate deformation vector fields to transform diagnostic CT into preliminary planning CT.
